## Git branching naming conventions

We can divide Git branches into two categories

1. Regular Branches: Permanent branches in repository

    1. Dev: Used for making changes in the code
    2. OA: Used for all automation testing
    3. Master: Default Branch

2. Temporary Branches: To be deleted when needed

    1. Bug fix
    2. Hot fix
    3. Feature Branch
    4. Experimental Branch
    5. WIP(Work in progress) branch

## Conventions

1. Start branch name with group word like WIP, feature, etc
2. Use unique id in names if there any, like bug id
3. Use hyphen or slash as seprator between words for better readibility
4. You can add author name to branch
5. Avoid long names for permanent branch
6. Avoid using every convention together

## Building a great PR

1. Well Named feature branch
2. Write appropriate commit messages and pr descriptions.
3. Describe your work properly in your PR
4. Add visual representation whenever possible for better understanding
5. Review your pr Yourself then assign it to others

## Contributing Code

1. Find issues available for contribution by community

    1. Look for issues with tag 'help wanted' or 'good first issue', these
    issues are meant for community contributions.
    2. Issues with tag 'staff only' are not meant for community, ignore.
    3. Issues with tags ' status: blocked', ' status: awaiting triage' and 'status: ticket work required' are also not meant for community.

2. Contribution Process: Once you have chosen the issue to work on, do the following:

    1. Comment on the issue that you are working on it
    2. Write code and submit PR, following all the pr guidelines
    3. Wait for feedback and collaborate accourdingly.

3. Creating a new Issue: If you cannot find an issue you want to work on in the issue section, create your new issue and wait for feedback.
